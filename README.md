# Web-Based Compiler

This web-based compiler allows users to write, compile, and run code for multiple programming languages directly in their web browser. It supports Solidity, Rust, and Motoko, and provides features such as code templates and difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).

## Overview

The project is divided into two main parts:
- **Frontend**: Built with React.
- **Backend**: Built with Node.js and Express.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **React** for building the user interface.
- **Bootstrap** and **CSS** for styling.
- **styled-components** for additional styling.

### Backend:
- **Node.js** and **Express** for the server.
- **MongoDB** for database storage.
- **dotenv** for environment variable management.
- Various Node.js modules for functionality:
  - **child_process** for running compiler commands.
  - **body-parser** for parsing request bodies.
  - **cors** for handling cross-origin requests.
  - **cookie-parser** for managing cookies.

## Features

- **Language Support**: Users can write and compile code in Solidity, Rust, and Motoko.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Provides predefined code templates for Easy, Medium, and Hard levels to help users get started.
- **User Authentication**: Users need to be logged in to compile code, with authentication handled via cookies and context.
- **Real-time Code Compilation**: Code is sent to the backend where it is compiled using the appropriate compiler. The output is then returned to the user.
- **Storing Compilation Data**: Compilation results, including user details, code, and outputs, are stored in the database for tracking and analysis.

## How It Works

### Frontend Process:

1. The user selects a programming language and difficulty level.
2. The user writes or edits the code in the provided code editor.
3. Upon clicking the "Compile" button, the code is sent to the backend for compilation.
4. The output from the compilation is displayed to the user.

### Backend Process:

1. The backend receives the code and the selected language.
2. The appropriate compiler (based on the selected language) is invoked to compile the code.
3. The compilation result, whether successful or with errors, is sent back to the frontend.
4. The backend also stores the compilation data, including the userâ€™s details, the code, and the result, in the database for future reference.

By following this process, users can write and test their code efficiently while the application handles the compilation and result management in the background.

## Running the Project

### Frontend

To run the frontend:


cd frontend
compiler/frontend
npm install
npm start
### Backend
To run the backend:

cd backend
compiler/backend
npm install
nodemon app
